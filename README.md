MYSQL API - using xampp
-----------------------
The first project featured here is a very basic mysql api that uses xampp. This api performs very basic activites such as the CRUD operations:
Create, Read, Update and Delete.

This Api enables the user to create his own custom database and tables, and is able to freely operate all the information in the database tables.
