                The reason this Api was created to to showcase the various things that<br> ive learnt in php/html/css 
                However, the main reason for its creation<br> would be for it to be shown in future job interviews.<br>
                It would prove to be effective in showing how much i know, and how much i dont.

                These images are based on the anime Maquia:When the promised flower blooms. <br>In my opinion its a great anime that everyone should watch. It shows the 
                difficulty of life, and the various troubles that many people overlook.
                The link to these images can be found <a href = 'https://wall.alphacoders.com/by_sub_category.php?id=300398&name=Maquia%3A+When+the+Promised+Flower+Blooms+Wallpapers'>here</a>
